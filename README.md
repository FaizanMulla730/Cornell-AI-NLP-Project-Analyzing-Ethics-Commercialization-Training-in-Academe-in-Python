# Cornell-AI-NLP-Project-Analyzing-Ethics-Commercialization-Training-in-Academe-in-Python


## Aim & Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the integration of research ethics and business commercialization in the curricula of various departments at Cornell University and to compare these trends with four other Ivy League schools: Harvard, UPenn, Columbia, and Yale. This comparative analysis seeks to understand how these institutions incorporate essential values such as ethics and commercialization into their academic programs over time.

## Summary of the Project
Our project investigates the variation and evolution of formal training in research ethics and commercialization practices across academic disciplines and universities over time. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with SpaCy, we cleaned and preprocessed vast amounts of textual data from course syllabi and institutional guidelines. Employing the KeyBERT model for keyword extraction, we identified key themes and trends in this training. We then analyzed the syllabi of courses from Cornell and compared the results with data from other Ivy League institutions. Our findings reveal important insights into how different fields and institutions prepare students for the ethical and commercial aspects of their research careers, highlighting areas for potential improvement. Through this comprehensive analysis, our project provides valuable insights into the evolution and current state of formal training in these areas. It also highlights potential gaps and areas for improvement, which can inform policy decisions and curriculum development.


## Results of the Comparative Analysis

The detailed analysis of the visualizations provides valuable insights into the integration of business and ethics-related keywords across Ivy League institutions. Key findings include:

●	Cornell University demonstrates a significant emphasis on both business and ethics-related keywords, reflecting its commitment to integrating these crucial concepts into its curriculum.

●	Harvard University and UPenn also show strong trends, particularly in management, economics, law, and sociology.

●	Columbia and Yale maintain steady trends, indicating consistent integration of business and ethics across various disciplines.


## Key Findings

Cornell University

1.	Trends Over Time:

●	Increasing trend of business-related keywords over the years, indicating a growing emphasis on business concepts in various disciplines.

2.	Discipline-Specific Analysis:

●	The highest frequency of business-related words is in Management courses, followed by Economics and Accounting.

●	Ethics-related keywords were prominent in Law, Sociology, and Economics courses.

## Comparative Analysis with Ivy League Schools

1.	Harvard University:

●	Similar trends were observed in the incorporation of business commercialization concepts in Management and Economics courses.

2.	UPenn:

●	Higher emphasis on ethics in History and Law-related courses compared to other institutions.

3.	Columbia University:

●	Strong focus on business concepts in their Business school, with significant integration of ethical training in Law and Social Sciences.

4.	Yale University:


●	Balanced integration of both business and ethics concepts across various disciplines, particularly in Economics and Political Science.
Importance of the Study


●	Understanding curriculum evolution helps institutions like Cornell adapt to changing industry needs.

●	Highlights the importance of ethical training in diverse fields, ensuring that graduates are well-equipped to handle contemporary challenges.

●	Provides a framework for future curriculum development aimed at fostering a balance between academic knowledge and practical skills.


## Future Recommendations

1.	Curriculum Development:

●	Encourage interdisciplinary courses that blend business concepts with ethical training to foster a holistic educational experience.

●	Promote the integration of business and ethics-related content in fields with lower keyword counts, such as basic computer skills and public safety.

2.	Policy Implications:

●	Institutions should emphasize ethical considerations in research and commercialization to prepare students for real-world challenges.

●	Develop policies that incentivize departments to incorporate business and ethics-related topics into their curricula.


3.	Future Research:

●	Expand the scope to include more universities globally to gain a broader perspective on the integration of business and ethics in higher education.

●	Analyze the impact of these curricular trends on student outcomes, such as employability and ethical decision-making in professional settings.
By implementing these recommendations, academic institutions can better prepare their students for the dynamic demands of the modern workforce, ensuring they possess both business acumen and a strong ethical foundation.


## Conclusion
Our study provides insights into how leading academic institutions are integrating crucial values such as research ethics and business commercialization into their curricula. Cornell University shows a positive trend in incorporating these concepts, aligning with industry demands and employment trends. The comparative analysis with other Ivy League schools highlights the varied approaches each institution takes to balance traditional academic content with emerging skills in ethics and commercialization. Understanding curriculum evolution is crucial for academic institutions like Cornell to adapt to changing industry needs. This study highlights the importance of ethical training in diverse fields, ensuring that graduates are well-equipped to handle contemporary challenges. By providing a framework for future curriculum development, this research aims to foster a balance between academic knowledge and practical skills, ultimately preparing students for a dynamic and ethical professional environment.
